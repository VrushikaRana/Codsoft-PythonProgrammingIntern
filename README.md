Hello everyone!!!!

Welcome to my Github Repository !!!

In this repository I will usually upload the projects tasks which was alloted to me as a part of Python Programming Virtual Internship @Codsoft.

Here I performed the coding for three tasks which are as under;

1. To Do List Command Line Application
2. Arithmetic Calculator Graphical User Interface(GUI) Application.
3. Game : Rock, Paper, Scissor (Command Line Application)

To Do Application creates, update,delete,and tracks the desired tasks. Coding is explained in easy manner.

Arithmetic Calculator basically appears as just the Calculator in your Mobile Phones.

Rock Paper Scissor is a game which we usually played during our childhood.

Hoping you will get the code and its understanding!!
